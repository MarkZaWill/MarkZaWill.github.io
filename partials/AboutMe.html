<div class="aboutme">I am therapist turned software developer. I enjoy language, solving puzzles, comic books, video games, and books without pictures as well.  I designed my personal site to be light and minimalist, so as to let what I am and what I can do shine through without the message being obscured. I want to make a difference in the world and I hope to use my skills to make the world a better place, one line of code at a time.</div>

<div>I get asked a lot of questions concerning my background.  This should help to clarify:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Why did you leave your previous career?</li>
	<ul>
		<li>I went into Psychology in order to help other people.  I liked Psychology and talking to other people, but I felt that something was missing.  I began to research software development and I discovered a new way to help make the world a better place.  I fell in love with data and finding new and creative ways to interact with that data when I was in graduate school.  As a software developer, I am very interested in handling, transforming, and understanding data so that it helps others.</li>
	</ul>
<li>
	What video games do you like?
</li>
<ul>
		<li>I finally beat Legend of Zelda II, Link's Adventure on 8/20/16. It only took me since January 14, 1987 to beat it. Otherwise, I love the  Metal Gear Solid series, pretty much all of Nintendo, Kingdom Hearts, and Ratchet & Clank.  </li>
	</ul>
<li>
	Do you like Science Fiction/Fantasy?
</li>
<ul>
		<li>Yes.</li>
	</ul>
<li>
	How many Pokemon do you have, currently? 
</li>
<ul>
		<li>My Pokedex says that I have caught 75, but I have seen 81. </li>
	</ul>
<li>
	What are your thoughts on...
</li>
<ul>
		<li>How about you email me.  My email is Markzawill@gmail.com and I am pretty friendly (the last remnant of my time as a mental health counselor) and who doesn't love getting friendly emails? </li>
	</ul>
</ul>
